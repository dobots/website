				<h2>Crownstone</h2>
				<p>
				DoBots offers an interesting component to a <strong>Smart Building</strong>, the Crownstone, a Bluetooth Low-Energy switching block that can be embedded everywhere in a building. Not only can people use their smartphones to control every wire in the building, but also the building knows where the people are.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Crownstone allows for services in buildings by people and for people. Bluetooth is an integral part to this strategy, because it demonstrates the seamlessness with which building automation will be integrated with smartphone solutions.
