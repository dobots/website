				<h2>Smart Robots</h2>

				If you heard about the Google car, then it’s safe to say the autopilot does just that for all moving devices but cars: we are enabling the mobility of machines and devices in the professional markets by adding the ‘brains’, in the form of software and mechatronics (vision and sensors).

				<h2>Smart Buildings</h2>
				<p>
				DoBots offers an interesting component to a <strong>Smart Building</strong>, the crownstone, a Bluetooth Low-Energy switching block that can be embedded everywhere in a building. Not only can people use their smartphones to control every wire in the building, but also the building knows where the people are.
