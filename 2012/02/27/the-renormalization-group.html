<h1 id="the-renormalization-group-on-networks">The renormalization group on networks</h1>

<p>Modern physics is actually one big quest to solve the many-body problem. Most
often stated in soundbites invented by famous people from for example the
influential Santa Fé school, but sometimes as old as Aristotle, such as “the
whole is greater than the sum of the parts”. In physics this often came to
mean: the whole is the sum of parts plus all their interactions. These
interactions can sometimes be neatly organised in the form of Feynmann
diagrams, the mysterious drawings you might sometimes see on the cover of
physics books.</p>

<h2 id="blocks">Blocks</h2>

<p>Not exactly a new kid on the block, we are somewhere in the 50s-70s, group
renormalization became a tool in particle physics to cope with the many
possible interactions between elementary particles. First of all, the
physicists borrowed from the old idea of considering a system at different
scales. Think of the different resolutions of for example Google maps.
Secondly, the physicist gave up on the idea that a system could be described
by a finite number of interactions, but instead of that realised that an
infinite number of interactions would not be such a big problem if the
relation of the “interaction landscape” (my words) on one scale would have a
simple reation with the “interaction landscape” on another scale. The example
often used in statistical physics is that of the Ising model which is a 2D
grid with so-called spins, that can point upwards or downwards. The spins
influence their neighbours: a spin aligns its orientation according to the
majority of its neighbours. By considering the larger scale of so-called block
spins, we take blocks of say 3x3 spins and assign a spin direction to this
larger block. Now, we have to come up with a description for the interactions
between the block spins on this higher level. Not only that, but these
interactions should also somehow be a coarse grained description of the
interactions on the lower level. The idea of group renormalisation is that by
repeating this pattern we end up with a flow from one “interaction landscape”
to another: a flow through the space of coupling constants. We now miss one
important piece of the puzzle to make sense of all this. This “flow” can
namely be very chaotic. However, there is one specific phenomenon that is
deeply related to the concept of scale invariance, which is the second order
phase transition. A second order phase transition is a critical phenomenon
that makes a system transition from one state to another in a very abrupt
manner. Think earthquakes, crackling noise, etc. A system that is “poised at
this edge of chaos” corresponds to a group renormalisation flow that is
directed towards a fixed point! We suddenly have a way to describe the global
behaviour - through a huge series of scales - from local interactions!</p>

<h2 id="network">Network</h2>

<p><img src="/attachments/renormalization_newman_and_watts.jpg" alt="Renormalization on networks" class="float-right"></p>

<p>This is all
very well, but nothing makes much sense without examples. We can give an
example of the Ising model, or of self-organised criticality with sandpiles
(Bak), but for swarm robotics, we are most interested in graphs. We have one
remark here, most graph-based research disregards the spatial embedding of
this graph in the real world, however, in our case of a network of robots,
this is instead one of the most interesting and challenging future directions
of “complex systems” research. The scientific world has been talking the last
decade about networks with the so-called small world property. Imagine a
network of people, where people correspond to the nodes on a graph and people
that know each other are represented by edges. Imagine these nodes on a
circle, and organise them a bit and you will see a structure as in Fig. 1
(from Newman and Watts publicly available paper [1]). The hypothesis is that
this small world property is a critial phenomenon, and hence group
renormalization can be applied.</p>

<h2 id="parameters-l-k-and-p">Parameters L, k and p</h2>

<p>We just summarize Newman and Watts findings here… The authors want to show
that if the number of “shortcuts” goes to zero, the system exhibits a second-
order phase transition observing the parameter <script type="math/tex">l</script>, the average distance between
vertices. Besides the system size <script type="math/tex">L</script>, and a parameter <script type="math/tex">k</script> which stands for some
fixed range for which every node is connected to all its neighbours, there is
a random parameter <script type="math/tex">p</script>. This <script type="math/tex">p</script> stands for a rewiring probability for every <script type="math/tex">kL</script>
connection (and is “quenched”, that means, it is only done once). The
renormalization procedure can be divided into two different cases, which is
very typical for the procedure. For <script type="math/tex">k=1</script>, their blocking procedure takes two
subsequent vertices on the ring and replaces them by one vertex. A “shortcut”
to one of the vertices is preserved and will now point to the new vertex. The
number of vertices <script type="math/tex">L</script> becomes <script type="math/tex">L/2</script>. The number of edges goes from <script type="math/tex">L</script> to <script type="math/tex">L/2</script> and
hence the probability to pick a given edge goes from <script type="math/tex">p</script> to <script type="math/tex">2p</script>. For the case of
<script type="math/tex">k>1</script>, the system size goes from <script type="math/tex">L</script> to <script type="math/tex">L/k</script>, the probability from <script type="math/tex">p</script> to <script type="math/tex">k^2 p</script>, the
range parameter goes from <script type="math/tex">k</script> to <script type="math/tex">1</script>, and the mean distance stays the same. Hence,
every system with <script type="math/tex">k>1</script> can be converted in a system with <script type="math/tex">k=1</script> and then a group
renormalisation procedure can be applied over and over again.</p>

<h2 id="the-transition">The transition</h2>

<p><img src="/attachments/renormalization_newman_and_watts_results.jpg" alt="Renormalization on networks, results" class="float-right"></p>

<p>The authors write down an expression for <script type="math/tex">l</script>, the
average distance between vertices. Let us not repeat the exact form of this
equation, but explain between which regimes the mentioned transition would
take place. If a system is really small, then for a given fixed <script type="math/tex">p</script>, there is on
average less than one shortcut in the graph. This means that the average
distance between vertices just happens over the ring and hence scales linearly
with the system size <script type="math/tex">L</script>. However, when the system becomes larger, and <script type="math/tex">p</script> is
still fixed, in the end shortcuts will show up, and the distance between
vertices will scale logarithmic with respect to <script type="math/tex">L</script>. The transition between
these two regimes is the one that interests us.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In Fig. 2 you can see that the authors indeed were able to show this continous
phase transition in the system. So, what do we have here!? We have a relation
between system size and the famous average number of “degrees of separation”
between nodes on a network. Now, you would be able to be all cocky on parties
and tell fellow nerds that it’s not just six degrees of separation between you
and some famous person, but that this depends on <script type="math/tex">L</script>, <script type="math/tex">p</script> and <script type="math/tex">k</script>: the system size,
the number of shortcuts, and the range of neighbours someone has.</p>

<p>This text introduced the renormalization group in networks. Interesting would be take these results and check how it can be applied to swarm robotics!</p>
