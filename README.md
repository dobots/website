# DoBots website

You can find this website at [www.dobots.nl](http://www.dobots.nl).

## Prerequisites

    sudo apt-get install rake
    sudo apt-get install rubyX.X.X-dev
    sudo gem install jekyll
    sudo gem install jekyll-assets
    sudo gem install jekyll-lunr-js-search

## Users

You can add a blog post by:

    rake post title="Your fancy title"
    
Now navigate to the file created for you and adjust it.

In case you have never worked with a markdown syntax before. It is quite easy. This very file is written in it! The variant of markdown that is used is called kramdown. A very short overview:

### Movie

A movie can be embedded by using 

    {% youtube YOUTUBE_ID %}

### Image

An image can be embedded by placing it in the attachments folder and link it through 

    ![Alternative description]({{ site.url }}/attachments/image_file.png "Image description")

An example of a right-floated image: 

    ![Meccano Spykee]({{ site.url }}/attachments/meccano_spykee_400.jpg "Meccano Spykee"){: .float-right} 

Here we use kramdown to use the css style `float-right`.

An example of a resized image: 

    ![Barbecue color]({{ site.url }}/attachments/barbecue_test_5.png "Barbecue color"){: style="width: 500px"}

### Equation

A mathematical equation can be described with

    $$y=x^2$$

### Code snippet

To add a piece of code formatted as a given language, use
 	~~~
	def what?
	 42
	end
	~~~
	{: .language-ruby}

Other syntax options you can probably find in no time searching online or checking other posts.

## Admin

The site is run through Jekyll:

    jekyll serve

Or if you have an older jekyll installation

    jekyll --server --auto

You can then see the website served at:

    localhost:4000
    
There is Procfile that allows you to run it on Heroku:

    web: jekyll serve -P $PORT
    
You can install a theme through:

    rake theme:install git="https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-program.git"
    
And switch a theme through:

    rake theme:switch name="flat"

If you want to adjust the theme, you have to navigate to `\_includes/themes/flat/` and `assets/themes/flat/`.

For running on Heroku, there is a Gemfile added. You add for example kramdown to it, or oembed and run "bundle install".

The information for the different plugins is stored in an `.env` file which is not pushed to github (it is part of the `.gitignore` file. Its content currently defines identifiers for Embedly and Google:

    EMBEDLY_KEY=...
    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY=...

Write here your own keys to get the analytics and use embedly (although the latter I found not so convenient in the end, requiring paid subscriptions already after showing a movie only several times).
