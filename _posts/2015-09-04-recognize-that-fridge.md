# Device recognition

After thorough preparation, we have lift-off with the development of device classification for the Crownstone! For now I'm using second-hand data and starting with basic techniques, but with an accuracy in tests of 93.7% after just the first week of actual implementation and experimentation, the future looks bright!

Here’s some stats and a confusion matrix of my latest cross-validation test, where you can see what kind of devices we can already identify. This classification method takes ‘traces’ of 24 hours as input, with a power level in Watts, each second. I extract 14 hand-implemented features from that data, and feed them through a [Random Committee classifier](http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc.dev/weka/classifiers/meta/RandomCommittee.html) from the Weka set. RandomCommittee follows the same concept as [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest).

The numbers correspond to classification results. The row pertains to the device from which the data was measured, and the column indicates the decision made by the classifier.

## Stratified cross-validation

Results are promising!

|----+----|
| Description                        | Quantity          | Percentage
|------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Correctly Classified Instances     |   1709            |   93.7466 % |
| Incorrectly Classified Instances   |    114            |    6.2534 % |
| Kappa statistic                    |      0.9337
| Mean absolute error                |      0.0065
| Root mean squared error            |      0.0537
| Relative absolute error            |     14.792  %
| Root relative squared error        |     36.2652 %
| Total Number of Instances          |   1823


## Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix shows which devices are easy and which ones are hard to distinguish from each other.
