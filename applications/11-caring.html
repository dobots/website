				<h2>Caring</h2>
				<p>
				The <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/products/crownstone">crownstone</a> allows your grandma or mother to <b>live independently
				at home</b>. Our technology acts like a virtual butler who takes care of elderly.
				</p>
				<p>
				This solution solves very down-to-earth problems such as "I find it difficult to go to the bathroom in the dark",
				or "I don't know if it is convenient to call my mother at this time", or "Is there someone who can keep an
				eye on about me not forgetting to turn off the electric kettle?"
				</p>
				<p>
				The crownstone is a very small chip that is put behind
				every power outlet in a building. The little chips are able to find out the position of any person wearing
				an emergency necklace or bracelet, a fitness band, or a smartphone.
				</p>
				<p>
				The crownstone is not without reason behind a wall socket. It is able to monitor the power usage of an
				electrical device very closely. This means that it can recognize if an appliance is an electrical kettle
				for example. And it can turn off devices that behave out of the ordinary as a smart software fuse.
				</p>
				<p>
				The technology that is used to communicate with the crownstones is smartphone technology. This means that
				when a certain event happens, for example, the television is plugged out at 1 o'clock in the night, it is
				easy to get an alarm. "What's going on at grandma's place?"

			<h2>Functionality</h2>
			<p>
			The crownstones are an advanced technological solution for independent living, but in essence they can be seen
			as upgrading a house to a virtual butler. This butler has only two main tasks. First, the house should aid in
			improving communication. Second, the house should help in performing daily tasks.

				<div class="center">
					<h3>Communication</h3>
					<p>
					The crownstone tells people when it is convenient to call. "Please, don't call when I'm taking a shower,
					I might get in a hurry and fall!". Such status is communicated as "Available" or "Busy" and of course
					does not intrude on privacy.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Emergency</h3>
					<p>
					Communication because something awkward is happening, or nothing happens for a while. It is important
					to know that everything goes fine with granny. However, if your mother didn't come out of bed for an
					entire day, this is worrisome. Better to know!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Safety</h3>
					<p>
					Yearly there are hundreds of fires in elderly homes because of faulty appliances or incorrect use of
					devices. The crownstone monitors devices, tells when they are broken, and can turn off the power if
					a device is used incorrectly.

					<h3>Aiding</h3>
					<p>
					Is it really worth the risk to trip at night, trying to find the way to the bathroom, half asleep? To
					have lights automatically turned on on your way to the bathroom at night is a small question to ask to
					contemporary technology, isn't it? Yes, for the crownstone it is!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
					A television and stereo set is suddenly plugged off in the middle of the night. Either, grandma has gone
					mad or somebody else is doing this! Time to signal	that there is something worth to check out!
					</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Gaming</h3>
					<p>
					Automation should not make someone inactive. Just as knowing how much energy you use, will make it easy
					to reduce energy consumption, so will knowing how much you watch television, make it possible to reduce
					it. Our infrastructure makes it possible to come up with all kind of game concepts to implement such or
					more serious matters yourself.

				<h2>More information</h2>
				<p>
				The above is only a small subset of the thought that went into this product. Our product differs from most
				technologies in the elderly care or health care sector, in that it is already useful for everybody (see
				general <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/applications/home">home</a> usage). It
				already reduces energy consumption to begin with. Moreover, it can be used in a professional setting, but
				it is customer-oriented and very interesting for anybody to buy for their parents or grandparents.
