				<h2>Hospitality</h2>
				<p>
				The iBeacon solution becomes more and more familiar to people. It is possible to track people in
				stores, restaurants, and other commercial establishments. Of course, the acceptance of a technology
				depends on mutual benefits. The role for the hospitality sector is therefore quite essential. From a
				potential big-brother solution it might find the perfect trade-off between benefit for the customer and
				the business.
				</p>
				<p>
				Similar to the Apple watch which is already getting incorporated in a few hotels, our
				<a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/products/crownstone">crownstones</a> can make your guests prefer your hotel above
				others! It is possible to automatically open room doors, turn on lights in an unfamiliar room, and
				automate check-in and check-out. This gets all enabled by knowing where your guests are. Especially
				speeding up the check-in and check-out process will be highly appreciated by many customers.

			<h2>Functionality</h2>
			<p>
			The crownstones makes it possible to reduce energy consumption as well as increasing comfort.

					<h3>Walk directly to your room</h3>
					<p>
					There is zero reason why a customer has to wait at desks when entering your establishment. It is very
					annoying and totally unnecessary. That is, if there is a way to circumvent the room key. Using
					smartphone technology in combination with indoor positioning this is trivially possible.
					</p>

					<h3>No cleaning personnel waking you up</h3>
					<p>
					Of course, it is possible to knock on the door of your clients, wake them up, and hear them grudgingly
					objecting against cleaning their room at this moment because they had a tough conference day or a vibrant
					party the night before. Is it really necessary to wake them up for something like cleaning if you would
					know that they are in their room anyway?

					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
					Someone plugging of the television. Perhaps its worth to take a look for the cleaning personnel at
					their daily duties. And plug it in for the next person making use of the room of course!

					<h3>Automatic lights</h3>
					<p>
					Naturally, it is possible to turn on lights automatically when someone enters the room. A very small
					thing to add. But maybe still nice for your first visitor arriving late at night with a heavy suitcase.
					And they can be turned off when they leave without bothering them at all.
					</p>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">

					<h3>Navigation</h3>
					<p>
					In large hotels and especially large cruise ships smartphone applications that display the floor plan
					are common place. But they don't know where you are! It would become so much easier to go to the sauna
					on deck five of a ship if it knows that you're on the fifth floor and can lead you around.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Services</h3>
					<p>
					It is very easy to couple services such as wireless internet to the physical location of a paying
					customer. The same is true for (getting feedback on) room cleaning, laundry facilities, wake-up
					calls, or room service. To know if someone in her room makes all these services both more pleasant
					and efficient.

				<h2>More information</h2>
				<p>
				The above is only a small subset of the thought that went into this product. It is clear that iBeacon-like
				technology is not limited to bar crawls, but can significantly enrich the experience of your guests.
