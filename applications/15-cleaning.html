				<h2>Cleaning Autopilot</h2>
				<p>
				Consumers have the Roomba and the Scooba: small cleaning robots that work autonomously to clean your house. But what does the professional cleaning industry have? A scrubber/dryer machine with a human operator to walk behind it. DoBots likes to change this!
				</p>
				<p>
				DoBots upgrades machines to fully autonomous robots. Therefore DoBots provides an add-on to cleaning machines, the so-called Autopilot.
				</p>
				<p>

				The autopilot is a package with sensors, controllers, and algorithms that allow a machine to navigate through a room fully autonomously. It can also be controlled manually or by remote.

				<h3>Complete Package</h3>
				<p>
				The autopilot knows the state of the batteries, the reservoirs, and can send cleaning performance reports. Extra functionalities can be aligned with the end-user.
				</p>

				<strong>Smart</strong> robots, are robots that can work in environments that were hitherto restricted to humans. Robots enter slowly the domestic part of the cleaning market, however, the professional cleaning industry, doesn't yet have the big brothers of the Roomba and the Scooba in operation.
				</p>
				<p>
				DoBots identified two key factors that allow robots to take over the market of professional floor cleaning. First, thanks to advances in the entertainment industry, the prices for 3D depth sensors dropped from a steep price range of €&nbsp;15.000,- to a stunning €&nbsp;150,- (Kinect). Second, the problem of a cleaning robot is not a hardware problem, it is a software problem. Algorithms for autonomous navigation matured considerably in the last few years.
				</p>
-->
				<p>
				Our offer:
					an autopilot below a €&nbsp;1000,- per machine.*
				</p>
				<p>
				How is this low price possible? First, the advances in the entertainment industry (in particular the Kinect) made the prices for 3D depth sensors drop from €&nbsp;15.000,- to a stunning €&nbsp;150,-.

				Second, autonomous cleaning is not a <strong>hardware</strong> problem, but a <strong>software</strong> problem with algorithms for autonomous navigation that matured considerably in the last few years.
				<p>
				*This contains the <strong>bill of materials</strong> for the physical part of one autopilot. Prior to this result is a development project or pilot in which a team from DoBots works closely together with your development team.
				</p>

				<h3>Pricing model</h3>
				<p>
				DoBots sees a misalignment between the end-user and the manufacturer of a cleaning machine: The user wants a clean floor, but has to pay for a machine... In our case, by paying a service fee, the cleaning company becomes responsible for the machine. This means they take care of it and upgrade it continuously with the newest brushes, batteries, and sweeping strategies.
				</p>

				<p>
				The algorithms of DoBots run in the cloud, together with additional services and are provided through a service contract of € 100,- per month. The autopilot adds € 1000,- to each cleaning machine.
				</p>
				<p>
				Example of savings: A cleaning person asks € 20,- per hour to do the cleaning job. With the autopilot from DoBots you save at least one cleaning hour per day. In this case our service model already saves you € 660,- per month.

			<h2>Service</h2>
			<p>
			There are many benefits for using robots in the floor cleaning industry.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Costs</h3>
					<p>
					DoBots provides it services through a service contract of €&nbsp;100,- per <strong>month</strong>. The autopilot adds €&nbsp;1000,- to the cleaning machine. Compare this with €&nbsp;20,- per <strong>hour</strong> for a cleaning person. Saving only one cleaning hour per day, amounts to saving €&nbsp;660,- per month.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Personnel diversification</h3>
					<p>
					DoBots wants to create services that work for and with people. Diversification of personnel: allows the creation of professional ladders (certificates), more diverse offerings to customers, and enriches interactions between colleagues. Cleaning activities should be fun: robots get the boring parts, controlling a robot empowers.

					<h3>Always the best</h3>
					<p>
					Currently there is a mis-alignment between the user and the manufacturer of a cleaning machine. The user wants a clean floor, but pays for a machine. By paying a service fee, the cleaning company becomes responsible for the machine, takes care of it, and upgrades it continuously with the newest brushes, batteries, and sweeping strategies.

			<h2>Functionality</h2>
			<p>
			The autopilot has navigation, localization, and sweeping functionality.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Navigation</h3>
					<p>
					A map can be uploaded to the robot, but the robot can also chart an area itself. Changes in the environment, such as containers, products or people are incorporated automatically.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Localization</h3>
					<p>
					No lost machinery, because the robot always knows where it is. In manual operation or with remote operation, the localization of the robot can be tracked as well. An anti-theft alarm system is also included.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Sweeping</h3>
					<p>
					The scrubber/dryer sweeps according to a self-created plan given the area to maintain. Via a user-friendly graphical interface, this can also be manually overridden by the end user.
					</p>
				</div>

			<h2>Status monitoring</h2>
			<p>
			Status of the device and the environment are easily monitored.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Coverage</h3>
					<p>
					The robot can report in real-time which part of the floor it has covered, so you can monitor it’s progress.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Battery</h3>
					<p>
					When battery life is low, the robot can seek for a recharge station thanks to it’s localization functions.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Water and soap</h3>
					<p>
					The robot offers an easy display for the level of water and soap. Is also possible to refill automatically if we robotize the mechanics of the cleaning machine.
