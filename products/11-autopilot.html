				<h2>Autopilot</h2>
				<p>
				We are enabling the mobility of machines and devices in the professional markets by adding the ‘brains’, in the form of software and mechatronics (vision and sensors).

				<h3>Context Aware</h3>
				<p>
				Any technology needs input to respond to. Like you need eyes and ears to move around without bumping into things, your applications need to know what is going on around them too.
				</p>
				<p>
				More and more devices are therefore equipped with sensors, sensing all kinds of characteristics about themselves and their environment. This makes them context aware. The autopilot uses these sensor data to let it’s machines move around efficiently.
				</p>

				<h3>Development Network Partners</h3>
				<p>
				DoBots works closely together with sister company Sense, part of the Almende group. Sense is an observation system specialist that provides the platform for analysing sensor data. DoBots uses and analyses that data to let it’s devices act on it.
				</p>

				<h3>Joint Development</h3>
				<p>
				DoBots want to open the door to new applications of mobile robotics and therefore likes to jointly develop innovative robotics applications with manufacturers. We’re also open to end-users.
				</p>
				<p>

				We provide our engineering services to build autopilot solutions tailored to your needs. We offer customers the expertise of our highly educated staff. As an ambitious young startup we’re ultra  flexible and proactive in thinking with you about new applications of mobile robotics! And did you know we won the Best European Startup Award in the Robot Launch competition?
				</p>
				<p>

				DoBots is your development partner from A to Z, but before we start anything we always get together with our customer first to map the advantages of a robotics solution. When you perceive added value and the possibility to scale, we may start the pilot and develop the prototype.

				<h3>Open source</h3>
				<p>
				Usually, devices all have their own languages, protocols and media. This leads to a lock-in: you will need all your devices made by the same company in order to let them communicate. DoBots creates its devices in such a way they can talk to every other device.
				</p>
				<p>
				To speed up development time, DoBots works primarily with open source solutions. Open source software can be built upon by any developer. When it comes to originating new ideas, rather than starting from scratch, companies are turning to open source software because it gives them the ability to not have to build from the ground up but rather start on a foundation that’s been built and refined by a slew of programmers over a period of time.

				<h3>Application</h3>
				<p>

				One of our applications is a cleaning robot for the professional cleaning sector: we don’t want a vacuum cleaner to be in our way when we walk through a room. We don’t want 10 robots cleaning the same spot over and over again. And we don’t want to have to open a door, every time the machine wants to clean a room. This means next to machine automation we need building automation. The current Internet of Things helps as a driver for machine to machine communication.

			<h2>Service</h2>
			<p>
			There are many benefits for using robots in the floor cleaning industry.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Costs</h3>
					<p>
					DoBots provides it services through a service contract of €&nbsp;100,- per <strong>month</strong>. The autopilot adds €&nbsp;1000,- to the cleaning machine. Compare this with €&nbsp;20,- per <strong>hour</strong> for a cleaning person. Saving only one cleaning hour per day, amounts to saving €&nbsp;660,- per month.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Personnel diversification</h3>
					<p>
					DoBots wants to create services that work for and with people. Diversification of personnel: allows the creation of professional ladders (certificates), more diverse offerings to customers, and enriches interactions between colleagues. Cleaning activities should be fun: robots get the boring parts, controlling a robot empowers.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Always the best</h3>
					<p>
					Currently there is a mis-alignment between the user and the manufacturer of a cleaning machine. The user wants a clean floor, but pays for a machine. By paying a service fee, the cleaning company becomes responsible for the machine, takes care of it, and upgrades it continuously with the newest brushes, batteries, and sweeping strategies.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<h2>Functionality</h2>
			<p>
			The autopilot has navigation, localization, and sweeping functionality.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Navigation</h3>
					<p>
					A map can be uploaded to the robot, or the robot can autonomously chart an area. Changes in the environment, such as containers, products, or people are incorporated automatically.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Localization</h3>
					<p>
					A robot always knows where it is. There will be no lost equipment. An anti-theft alarm system is included. In manual operation or with remote operation, the localization of the robot can be tracked as well.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Sweeping</h3>
					<p>
					The scrubber/dryer sweeps according to a self-created plan given the area to maintain. This can also be manually overridden by the end user in a friendly graphical interface.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<hr class="sep">

		<div class="row">
			<h2>Status</h2>
			<p>
			Status of the device and the environment are easily monitored.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Battery</h3>
					<p>
					The autopilot knows the state of the batteries. Thanks to its localization capabilities it can find a recharge station. Deep discharging will be prevented automatically by communication to the maintenance team. The lifetime of the robot is greatly enhanced by monitoring for required maintenance.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Coverage</h3>
					<p>
					The robot knows where it went. The state of the floor can be directly reported, and truthfully so. Different from a human, a robot can operate in a 24-hour setting, in "performance-based" settings.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Water and soap</h3>
					<p>
					The level of water and soap are easily displayed to a cleaning person. In robotizing the mechanics of the cleaning machine it is also possible to refill automatically.
					</p>
